        What is the mode in a set of numbers?
    </p>
    <p class="text-xl">
        The mode is the number (or range of numbers) that occurs most often in
        a set of numbers.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xl">
        For example, the most dog weights (6 of them) are in the range between
        40 and 50 lb.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xl">
        So, the mode for this set of data is between 40-50 lb.
