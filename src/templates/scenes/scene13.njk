        <p class="text-xl">
            For example, letâ€™s say we wanted to find the average of this set
            of 15 dog weights.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xl">
        We would first add all of the weights together.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg">
            The total is 631.3.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg">
            Then we divide that total by 15 (since there are 15 numbers in the
            set).
        </p>
        <p>
        <code>
            631.3 / 15 = 42.1
        </code>
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg">
            That would give us the mean of 42.1 lb.
