# di_module
temporary repo until i move this code elsewhere

# installation

`npm install`

# usage 

(in vs-code)

* in bottom left, you will see ">NPM SCRIPTS"
  * expand that
  * if you hover over (wrench icon) "start", a right arrow button will get displayed
    * click on that  (this is the equivalent to vs codes "go live", but it works
      for files which require processing prior to serving them to your webrowser)
  * build processes all of the files, but doesn't serve them to your browser. All of the
    files are simply compiled and a 'di' folder is created, which is the generated
    portion of the website for this "app"
